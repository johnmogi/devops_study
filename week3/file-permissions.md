Linux divides the file permissions into read, write and execute denoted by r,w, and x. The permissions on a file can be changed by 'chmod' command which can be further divided into Absolute and Symbolic mode. The 'chown' command can change the ownership of a file/directory.

d rwx rwx rwx
[t] [owner] [group] [others]

d [file type ]

r - reading
w - writing
x - executing (for directories this means being searchable)
