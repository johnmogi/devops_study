Networking in a Nutshell [5]

{{ What is a network? Well, a network is nothing more than a collection of connected devices and end points and end systems with the purposes of exchanging and sharing information.

Now, today the network is a collection of devices and end systems, but those end systems include almost anything, not only computers, servers, but also telephones and cell phones and industry-automation machines that will now be involved in the exchange of information. That means we are exchanging not only data or traditional data in the form of files and other components, but also voice and video and multimedia collaboration.
