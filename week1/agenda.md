01 lecture 1:
history before devops
agile development - communication, collaboration culture during the sdl:
plan | code | test| release | deploy | operate

dev || wall of confusion || ops
waterfall
patrick debois - developed ops methologies and concieved the devops vision (2007) break the wall between the dev and ops
agile and scrum metholodogies
devops is.... [automatiom, collaboration, iaas, monitoring]
ci -> continious delivery (production) continious deployment (staging)
dev - plan
ops - deploy
what is devops?
devops is the union of people. process, and products to enable continious delivery of value to your end users
develop | build & test | deploy | operate
monitor & learn | plan & track {continious delivery}
history - local machine -> development script (automation) -> multiple developers
into git -> dev script -> CI/CD -> dev/ staging/ qa/ production
what is ci/cd - code -> commit/ related code ->
ci pipeline: build, unit tests, integration test
cd pipeline: review, staging, production
monolithic architecture vs microservices archtiecture
microservices allows us to diversify various stacks and easier scale - optimal usage of resources.
versions - each client can upgrade it's microservice and run independently
how to face the cloud? how to build and finance in the best way our strategy and connect various components in the cloud
how to make divisions and inner seperations within the IT cloud.
IAAS - the transition of IT into code - we can monitor changes and followup processes. we can now rollback and control.
terraform - declerative
pulumi - informative (from within the actual programming language- python nodejs to build machines)
configuration management -
infrastructure as code only sends the parts into the machine - a configuration management toll actually directs the inner parts
chef, puppet, ansible - takes the code and send it to the servers from gi for example
ansible has the advantage since it doesnt require agents or any previous installments.
jenkins is a cicd tool
azure devops works seamlessly with kube and containers, jenkins can also do it but has other robust features
devops consists of many tools - understand the stages and parts and focus on the big picture
devops roadmap - source control | CICD | IAAS| configuration management | microservices
DEV - development | tests | data | modern development
OPS - server administration | it automation | networking | security | containers | analysis

devops parts - source control | CICD | IAAS| configuration management | monitoring | microservices | containers \ contatainers orchestration
on premise - working on customer server

source control - tracks and manages code - git distributed.

DevOps Essentials
[What is DevOps]

- innovate faster, responsive to buissness needs, better collab, quality, more frequent releases,
  DevOps = new mindset + new Tools + new skills

dramaticly speed up the dev code into production process
reduces differences between production and dev enviroments
automating infrastructure - monitor, meaure and improve the code through automation
configuration managment code
source control system / github -> code deployment tools such as jenkins/ chef/ puppet

תפקיד שמחבר בין אגף הפיתוח לאגף הסיסטם
אדם שאחראי על עדכוני גרסה באופן אוטומטי
כדי ליצור יחד תכנה משומנת דורש הרבה כישורים
יכולות טכניות

devops is small deployments

ALM- aplication lifecycle management
the entire life cycle from the development to the deploy to when the application is no longer used
alm represents a new model towards software development

plan, create - CI - once i plan i do and test... constant check my code
unit tests and packaging
iaas integration
devops is not a one man show- it's a full orchestration of tools culture and people
noOPS - is a common market need to build automations and manage without devops but in the same way program languages are simplified and that makes more demand

[Why do we need DevOps] https://www.appdynamics.com/topics/why-devops-is-important#~benefits-of-devops
Maximizes Efficiency with Automation
Optimizes the Entire Business
Improves Speed and Stability of Software Development and Deployment
Gets You to Focus on What Matters Most: People

Challenges of DevOps
Choosing the Right Metrics is Hard | Limited Funds | Complexity | Unrealistic Goals, Bad Metrics Can Wreck DevOps

The Future of DevOps
Automation Will Play a Major Role
AIOps Will Make Service Uptime Easier to Achieve (artificial intelligence for IT operations.)
Will Sharpen Focus on Cloud Optimization

a modern way to break barries between dev and ops

SDLC - software development lifecycle
multiple steps, plan modify repetitions and involvement overall.

- circular process - feedback - repeats for major releases.

feasibility study - do we have the resources - both time and staff to complete the project?
requirement analysis - rules, reports, use cases - design screens - needs to be approved by the customer prior to work
design - logical and physical (db) review by [dev, ops,customer]
code - programming to meet buissness requirement, unit tests, demonstrations
test - make sure it works, unit and integration tests, load test, uat - user acceptance test
deploy - release to production, roll out complex systems, check for outages and hardware upgrades
operate maintain - support, help desk software fixes, patching and maintnance

in plain hebrew
devops - a culture, guidelines and practices
to ease the develop, it operations, and security
devops - builds automated processes - builds log and alerts from the client server
help sort out the mess in the organisation
