# [Orchestration]
o is the ability to manage several containers at the same time, it takes many factors into consideration, from networking to volumes for data persistence but the main focus is on managaing and controlling multiple instances (e.g. containers)

[What is Container Orchestration]
is the ability to manage, schedjule, supervise and auto rebuild replicasets of clusters, container groups etc.


[Why do we need Container Orchestration]
a simple evolution question - at first we proceeded to docker compose from dockerfile and cli then into k8s to allow full scale redundant clusters that can grow and expand automaticlly.
also for the samereason IAC is a thing- it adds consistency, and speeds work stabilisation.
